我叫郑瑞，2016年毕业。毕业之后进入国美商城的会员组，从事用户、sso、消息平台的相关工作。后来离职去了一家创业公司，做一些保险经纪平台相关的开发。再后来我来到了杭州，进入了格家网络，负责用户、权限、触达系统的开发和维护，后期调去了搜索组，负责搜索平台的开发和维护。然后最近的就是去年离职进入了滴滴，被调去支持橙心优选，在橙心优选经历的部门比较多，因为也算是创业阶段，组织调动比较频繁。最开始是在增长团队负责触达、券相关的工作。后来跟着老板去了数据团队，开发经营指挥系统，做BD的目标和绩效管理。后来老板又承接了结算相关的工作，后来就慢慢独立出来一个结算中台。就是我现在待的组，从事计费、清结算相关的工作。
